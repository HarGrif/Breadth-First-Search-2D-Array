# Breadth-First Search of a 2D Array
Breadth-First Search is a map solving algorithm for 2D arrays that returns the shortest path or flags a map as unsolvable.

It was created as a sub-project of my Final Year Project on Genetic Algorithms at University to ensure that maps passed to the GA as training data were solvable.
